## Process

An auction, like you might see when selling a house or when on ebay, consists of an auctioneer (the one representing the seller) and bidders. You can have an open auction, where bidders are aware of the other bids and thereby bod higher until only one bidder is left winning the auction with the highest bid. There is also a "blind auction", where bidders are not aware of the other bids. A bidder is likely to make one bid, going as low as they can while high enough to beat other bidders.

The intermediary in the case of the auction is the auctioneer. As is the advantage with blockchains and smart contracts, this party can be removed. Also, it is possible for the seller to back out or attempt to adjust the terms of sale after a traditional auction has ended. A smart contract enabled auction will correct these two disadvantages and improve the auction process.

An auction is perhaps a human primitive, at least in the financial field. There is something fundamental about someone wanting to sell something, with a group of individuals all wanting to buy it, and the ensuing process of bidding higher and higher until only one bidder is left. Given the auction as a fundamental human behavior it is a perfect candidate for improvement using smart contracts and a blockchain.
