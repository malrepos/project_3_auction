![alt=""](images/Auction.png)

An auction is a sales event wherein potential buyers place competitive bids on assets or services either in an open or closed format. Auctions are popular because buyers and sellers believe they will get a good deal buying or selling assets. It usually involves the process of buying and selling goods or services by offering them up for bids, taking bids, and then selling the item to the highest bidder or buying the item from the lowest bidder.

When we hear of an auction our thoughts naturally gravitate to a lot of people in one room being engaged by the auctioneer. This still occurs till today for certain commodities. However, there are also quite a number of auctions conducted online via various platforms.

Pros of Auctions

- Buy at a discount if allowed

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

An NFT auction is an internet platform that allows the trading of non-fungible tokens for a fixed price or at an auction amount. Our platform was built to enable the buy and sell of various NFTâ€™s. 
The fintech industry can be seen as a rearing ground for adoption of this emerging technology. Existing companies may deploy smart contract to make their processes more cost and time efficient. The use of smart contracts in the fintech industry can be seen as a solution that can enable more efficient monitoring and execution of complex and large derivative contracts are usually based on comprehensive master agreements. For instance, payment related provisions of a contract that requires one party to pay a certain amount to another party upon the completion of certain events e.g., an auction bid being approved can be coded into a smart contract which will enable an automatic execution.


#### BACKEND
A smart contract was written in solidity to handle the auctions and the NFT's will be ERC tokens which contained steps -
- We defined the Pragma and contract
- We state the variables involved 
- Set up the Constructor 
- Create the Bid function (E.g Set a block to prevent the owner from bidding, block $0 value bids )
- Adding a withdrawal pattern (we opted for manual withdrawal rather than automatic as this proved the safest)
- Added a function to prevent bids from being withdrawn until the end of the auction
